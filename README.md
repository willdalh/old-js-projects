## Old JS Projects

A collection of projects I did in JavaScript while learning programming. During this time, I hosted these projects on [updog.co](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123041333/https://updog.co/), a service which was discontinued early 2020. The projects can now be viewed through [willdalh.github.io/old-js-projects](https://willdalh.github.io/old-js-projects/).
